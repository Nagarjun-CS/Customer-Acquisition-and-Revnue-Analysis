# Customer Acquisition and Revenue Analytics

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior, revenue generation, and product adoption trends through the **Customer Acquisition and Revenue Analytics Dashboard**. The analysis covers customer demographics, sales pitch durations, follow-up strategies, and product revenue contributions. The goal is to gain insights into key factors driving customer acquisition and improve overall revenue performance by optimizing marketing and sales strategies.

The dashboard was developed using **Excel** for data aggregation, **Python** for data cleaning, and **Tableau** for visualization.

## Features and Approach
- **Customer Segmentation**: The analysis provides insights into customer behavior based on age, occupation, city tier, and product preferences.
- **Sales Strategy Optimization**: By analyzing pitch duration and follow-up patterns, the dashboard identifies the most effective strategies for converting potential customers.
- **Revenue Breakdown**: The project highlights revenue contributions by different customer segments, products, and regions.
- **Conversion Metrics**: Conversion rate, customer acquisition cost (CPA), and return on investment (ROI) metrics are included to assess the effectiveness of marketing strategies.

### Approach:
1. **Data Aggregation**: Collected customer and revenue data using **Excel** to prepare for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Utilized **Python** to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
3. **Visualization**: Used **Tableau** to create interactive dashboards showcasing customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends.
4. **Analysis**: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and insights that help optimize marketing and sales efforts.
